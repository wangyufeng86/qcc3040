# USR2 Setting for earbud to have a fixed role. 
# If this key is not set then the earbud will be able to switch roles (recommended)
# If fixed roles are to be used each earbud pair must have one primary and one secondary. 
# This setting is currently only supported on ROM based QCC512x parts.
#USR2 = [ 01 00 ] #Uncomment to set the earbud to always be a primary device
#USR2 = [ 02 00 ] #Uncomment to set the earbud to always be a secondary device

# USR3 Setting for the earbud to enable device testing. 
# If this key is not set, or is zero, then the device test service is not available
# Setting to 01 00 means that the earbud will enter device test mode on boot, 
# and WILL NOT enter normal operation
#USR3 = [ 01 00 ] # Uncomment to enable device test mode
